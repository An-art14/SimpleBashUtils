I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban- I'm a bandito
I could take the high road


But I       know that I'm going low
I'm a ban- I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban- I'm a        bandito

This is the sound we make
When in name between two places


Where we used to bleed
And where  name our blood needs to be
